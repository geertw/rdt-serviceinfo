This directory contains two plugins for [Munin](http://munin-monitoring.org/) which show the number of services
in the database and the number of processed ARNU messages.

Just copy them to your plugin directory and change the directory to your installation directory. You can test the
plugins by running them in your shell, they should produce some numbers.
